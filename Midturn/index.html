    <p>Whenever you are shopping around for a car it is important to do your research before you come to make a
        decision. Many buyers will think about if it is better to lease or buy a car based on your financial needs.
        Setting a budget would be the first thing to do so you see if you can financially afford the vehicle you want.
        Some things to consider when selecting a vehicle would be like car size, color, miles per gallon and price.</p>
