    <h2>Summary Statement</h2>

    <p> the switch must be configured with an IP address and a subnet mask. Keep in mind that to manage the switch from
        a remote network, the switch must be configured with a default gateway. This is very similar to configuring the
        IP address information on host devices. In the figure, the switch virtual interface (SVI) on S1 should be
        assigned an IP address. The SVI is a virtual interface, not a physical port on the switch. A console cable is
        used to connect to a PC so that the switch can be initially configured.</p>
